#+title: nvm.el

Although there is already a library called =nvm.el= on ELPA, I decided to create this one that integrates with [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] and [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]. Also allows you to download both [[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm][nvm]] and node versions.

** Variables
If you already have nvm installed and it is not Emacs env =NVM_DIR= or it is not =~/.nvm=, you can set it on =nvm-dir= variable.

** API
Check functions' doc.

|-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *nvm-use-project-version* | Use (install if necessary) nvm set in the current roject's =.nvmrc= file |
| *nvm-get-current*         | Return the current node version in Emacs path                          |

|-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|

** Install
Download this =nvm.el= and put it on your =load-path=.

Notice that =nvm.el= uses helm, projectile and two of my own libs: =lauremacs/.emacs.d/laurisp/functional= and =lauremacs/.emacs.d/laurisp/laurisp-core=.
