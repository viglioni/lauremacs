** About
My new emacs configuration
   
🚧 *[WIP]* 🚧

 *I'm developing it on*
- MacOS 🍎
- using Emacs ~29.0.50~

*First use issues*
- there are unsolved dependencies with packages that I didnt solve yet to plug and play. Only =m-x package-install [package]= that is missing from first install

** How to use it
Clone this repo to your ~home~ dir and run

Make the script executable

  #+begin_src shell :exports both :results output
    chmod +x ~/lauremacs/scripts/lauremacs
  #+end_src

Add script's dir to path (optional)

#+begin_src shell :exports both :results output
  echo 'PATH=~/lauremacs/scripts:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
#+end_src

Run with

#+begin_src shell :exports both :results output
  lauremacs
  lauremacs -nw # open emacs on shell
#+end_src
   
Note that if you clone this in another place, you will need to change ~lauremacs-dir~ inside [[./init.el][init.el]].

** Load files and dirs
- After ~.emacs.d/init.el~ is loaded, it will load ~.emacs~, you can put adicional config there.
- The dir ~~/private-files/emacs-files~ will be added recursivelly to emacs load path.
- The file ~~/private-files/emacs-files/env-private.el~ is current be loaded in ~.emacs~, but won't throw any errors if this file does not exist.
